# preprocessing_artcode
This is a small preprocessing phase of my Master's degree stage.

the goal of this code is to preprocess the artcode (code that runs on a hosiery machine) in order to retrieve important informations composing a dataframe.

starting from an artcode (textual file that represents the code running on hoisery machines) a dataframe which relates many informations embedded in the artcode is created.
